## Requirement and analysis

      The requirement analysis for this web-app involves identifying the needs and functionalities necessary to address student stress related to placement interviews. The app should facilitate placement scheduling, which can be achieved through automation and digitalization of the process. This can help streamline the scheduling process, reduce uncertainty, and minimize delays for students.
      
      Furthermore, the app should enable better communication among students, allowing them to share insights and advice. This can be achieved through the implementation of a messaging or discussion forum feature within the app.
      
      Additionally, the app should provide companies with the ability to log in and issue placements directly at the university. This feature can simplify the placement process for companies and ensure a more efficient and organized system for the university's administration.

### Problem Definition


      The web-app in question is designed to address the issue of student stress related to placement interviews. The primary functionality of this app includes placement scheduling, which helps streamline the process and reduces uncertainty for students. Additionally, the app facilitates communication among students, allowing them to share insights and advice, thereby fostering a supportive community.

### Requirement Specification
### Hardware Requirements
        The hardware requirements for web development with ASP.NET can vary depending on the complexity of your projects and the scale of your applications. However, here are some general recommendations:
         
        Processor (CPU): A modern multi-core processor (such as Intel Core i5 or higher, or AMD Ryzen 5 or higher) will provide good performance for development tasks.

        Memory (RAM): At least 8GB of RAM is recommended for smooth development experience. If you're working on larger projects or running virtual machines, consider 16GB or more.

        Storage: An SSD (Solid State Drive) is highly recommended for faster disk read/write speeds, which can significantly improve the performance of your development environment. A capacity of 256GB or more is suggested, depending on your storage needs.

        Operating System: You can develop ASP.NET applications on Windows, macOS (using tools like Visual Studio for Mac or JetBrains Rider), or Linux (using tools like Visual Studio Code with the .NET Core SDK) Ensure that your chosen operating system is up to date and compatible with the .NET development tools.

        Graphics: A dedicated graphics card is not required for web development unless you're also doing graphics-intensive tasks like game development or graphic design. The integrated graphics on modern CPUs are generally sufficient for coding and web development.

       Monitor: A high-resolution monitor or multiple monitors can improve productivity by providing more screen real estate for coding, debugging, and testing.

       Network: A reliable internet connection is essential for accessing online resources, version control systems (such as Git), and deploying applications to servers.

       Peripherals: A comfortable keyboard, mouse or trackpad, and possibly a drawing tablet if you're doing any design work.


### Software Requirements
      To develop web applications with ASP.NET using C#, you'll need a combination of development tools, frameworks, and other software components. Here's a list of the essential software requirements:

      Integrated Development Environment (IDE):Visual Studio: Microsoft Visual Studio is the preferred IDE for ASP.NET development. It provides a comprehensive set of tools for building, debugging, and deploying web applications. Visual Studio Community edition is free and suitable for individual developers and small teams.
     
     .NET SDK:.NET SDK: Install the .NET SDK, which includes the necessary tools and libraries for building and running .NET applications. You can download it from the official .NET website or install it via   Visual Studio.

      Web Server:Internet Information Services (IIS): IIS is a web server created by Microsoft and often used for hosting ASP.NET applications in production environments. It's included with Windows operating  systems but may need to be enabled through the Control Panel.
      
      Database Management System:Microsoft SQL Server: SQL Server is commonly used with ASP.NET applications for data storage and retrieval. You can use the SQL Server Express edition for development purposes, which is available for free from Microsoft.

      Version Control:Version control is essential for managing code changes and collaborating with team members. Install Git for source code versioning. You can use platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket  for hosting your repositories.

      Web Browser:Any modern web browser such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Microsoft Edge is suitable for testing and debugging your web applications.

      Operating System:ASP.NET development can be done on Windows, macOS, or Linux. However, certain features may be more accessible or better supported on Windows due to Microsoft's ecosystem.
      
      Additional Tools and Libraries:Depending on your specific requirements, you may need additional tools or libraries for tasks such as frontend development (JavaScript frameworks like React, Angular, or     Vue.js), dependency management (NuGet), or task automation (npm, Gulp, or Grunt).
